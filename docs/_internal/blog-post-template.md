# How to Create an MCP Server in Node.js in 2025

> **How do I create an MCP server in Node.js?**
> Use **`mcp-server-generator`**, a Node.js CLI that scaffolds a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server with tools, resources, prompts, transports, and tests.
> **Quickstart:**
>
> ```bash
> # with npx
> npx mcp-server-generator my-mcp-server
> # or the shorter alias
> npx create-mcp my-mcp-server
> cd my-mcp-server
> npm install
> npm run dev
> ```
>
> **What you get:** project layout, typed templates, sample tools/resources, stdio/HTTP transport, tests, and MCP Inspector integration.  
> **Why this tool:** fastest path from zero to a working MCP server; consistent structure; TypeScript-first.

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is gaining momentum as the standard for AI assistant integrations. If you're looking to build an MCP server, you want to get started quickly without reinventing the wheel.

## The Problem with Building MCP Servers from Scratch

Creating an MCP server traditionally involves:
- Understanding the MCP specification
- Setting up TypeScript configuration
- Implementing transport layers (stdio, HTTP)
- Creating tools, resources, and prompts
- Setting up testing and validation
- Configuring development workflows

This can take days or weeks, especially if you want production-ready quality.

## The Solution: mcp-server-generator

The `mcp-server-generator` CLI eliminates all the boilerplate and gives you a production-ready MCP server in seconds.

### One Command Setup

```bash
npx mcp-server-generator my-analysis-server
```

That's it! You now have a complete MCP server with:

### ✨ What You Get Out of the Box

- Comprehensive error handling
- Component extension system

### Quick Testing

See everything at once:
```bash
npm run quick:test
```

Start development:
```bash
npm run dev:stdio    # For Claude Desktop
npm run dev:http     # For web integration
```

Visual testing:
```bash
npm run inspector
```

## Extending Your MCP Server

The real power comes from the extension system. Add new components instantly:

```bash
# Add custom tools
npx mcp-server-generator add tool calculator
npx mcp-server-generator add tool file-manager

# Add resources
npx mcp-server-generator add resource user-guide
npx mcp-server-generator add resource api-docs

# Add prompts
npx mcp-server-generator add prompt code-review
npx mcp-server-generator add prompt analysis-helper
```

Each component is automatically integrated with proper TypeScript types and registry updates.

## Real-World Example: Claude Desktop Integration

Want to use your MCP server with Claude Desktop? Here's how:

1. **Generate the server:**
   ```bash
   npx create-mcp claude-helper
   cd claude-helper
   ```

2. **Start stdio mode:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev:stdio
   ```

3. **Add to Claude Desktop config:**
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "claude-helper": {
         "command": "node",
         "args": ["/path/to/claude-helper/dist/server.js"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Test the integration:**
   Your MCP server now provides all 8 tools, 9 resources, and 3 prompts directly in Claude Desktop!

## Why This Approach Works

**🎯 Unified Example**: Instead of scattered demos, you get one comprehensive Data Analysis Assistant showcasing ALL MCP features.

**🏗️ Clean Architecture**: Modular design with proper separation of concerns makes it easy to understand and extend.

**📚 Educational Value**: Learn MCP best practices through real-world implementation.

**🧪 Integrated Testing**: MCP Inspector ready-to-use with pre-configured scripts.

## Alternative: The Short Command

For the quickest start, use the alias:
```bash
npx create-mcp my-server
```

Both `create-mcp` and `mcp-server-generator` are identical - choose whichever feels more natural.
